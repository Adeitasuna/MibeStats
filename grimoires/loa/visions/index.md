# Vision Registry

Speculative insights captured during bridge loop iterations.
Each vision represents an architectural connection or paradigm insight
that transcends the current task — Google's 20% time, automated.

## Status Lifecycle

```
Captured → Exploring → Proposed → Implemented
                                → Deferred
```

| Status | Meaning |

| **Captured** | Raw insight from bridge review, not yet explored |
| **Exploring** | Under active investigation in a vision sprint |
| **Proposed** | Architectural proposal generated, awaiting cycle allocation |
| **Implemented** | Built into the codebase (with cycle reference) |
| **Deferred** | Reviewed but not prioritized for current roadmap |
